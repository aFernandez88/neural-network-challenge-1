## Student Loan Repayment Prediction Model

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of student loan repayment. The model will assist our company in providing more accurate interest rates to borrowers based on their repayment probability.

## Dataset

The project uses a CSV file containing information about previous student loan recipients, including features such as credit ranking.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into four main parts:

1. Data Preparation
2. Model Compilation and Evaluation
3. Loan Repayment Success Prediction
4. Discussion on Creating a Recommendation System

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Google Colab account
- Access to the provided CSV file
- Basic knowledge of Python, machine learning, and neural networks

### Installation

1. Open the starter file in Google Colab.
2. Upload the CSV file to your Colab environment.

## Usage

Follow the steps in the Colab notebook to:

1. Prepare the data for use in a neural network model.
2. Compile and evaluate the model using a neural network.
3. Use the trained model to predict loan repayment success.
4. Engage in a discussion about creating a recommendation system for student loans.
